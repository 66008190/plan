راهکارهای پیشنهادی بهبود عملکرد ارزیابی شونده مربوط به این بند، شامل عدم مدیر زمان و فشردگی کارها در مرحله آخر، ضعف در برنامه&shy;ریزی به موقع امور، مدیریت بهینه زمان و برنامه ریزی سالیانه و تمرکز بر فعالیت های حوزه کاری و پرهیز از کارهای متفرقه:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"RTL\">\r\n\tاینجانب به طور همزمان بخش مراسم مسابقات و فعالیت&shy;های قرآنی دانشگاه را عهده&shy;دار هستم. که بخشی از فعالیت&shy;های صورت گرفته در نیم سال اول تحصیلی 95 -96 (از شهریور تا دی ماه ) به پیوست ارائه می&shy;گردد. در سه ماه دی بهمن و اسفند ماه 1395، برپایی مرحله دانشگاهی مسابقات قرآن کریم بخش شفاهی و هماهنگی برپایی بخش کتبی این مسابقات به همراه برنامه&shy;های مناسبتی دهه فجر و مسابقاتی که در این خصوص برگزار گردید، همچنین مسئول و دستیار مسئول سه اردوی دانشجویی مشهد مقدس معاونت فرهنگی، همکاری در شانزدهمین جشنواره پایان نامه&shy;های قرآنی دانشجویان، همکاری در برپایی جشنواره لباس مشاغل اداری بانوان و برپایی مسابقه کتابخوانی شهدا، تنها بخشی از کارهای اینجانب در سال 1395 بوده است. که به نظر می رسد این چند مسیولیتی و همکاری با کارکنان دیگر معاونت فرهنگی و اجتماعی به جای اینکه نقطه مثبت عملکرد اینجانب در نظر گرفته شده جز نقاط منفی ذکر شده است. در مورد مدیریت زمان و برنامه ریزی سالیانه، نامه اداری شماره 616/6/95د با موضوع ارائه برنامه&shy; سالانه فرهنگی سال 1395 توسط اینجانب تنظیم و به خانم دکتر خادمی ارسال گردیده و به نظر می&shy;رسد این مورد نیز باید جزو نقاط قوت اینجانب محسوب می&shy;شده نه نقاط ضعف. در خصوص عبارت ذکر شده در فرم ارزیابی (تمرکز بر فعالیت&shy;های حوزه کاری و پرهیز از کارهای متفرقه) باید اعلام کنم اینجانب و بسیاری از همکاران دیگر معاونت فرهنگی به طور فعال در اکثریت برنامه&shy;های این واحد که در حوزه کاری ما تعریف نشده همکاری می&shy;کنیم و به این قضیه، هم به دید کار گروهی و هم به دید کمک به همکار نگاه می&shy;کنیم.&nbsp; کار متفرقه دیگری که اینجانب انجام داده&shy;ام همکاری در برپایی امتحانات پایان ترم گروه معارف دانشگاه بوده که در این خصوص نیز خانم دکتر خادمی موافقت خود را با این همکاری اعلام نمودند که نامه اداری آن موجود می&shy;باشد. در خصوص سرپرستی و دستار سرپرستی اردوی مشهد با توجه به اینکه هیچ یک از کارکنان معاونت فرهنگی شرایط انجام این کار را نداشتند، بنده تنها به دلیل اینکه اردوی مشهد مقدس بود، با وجود اینکه صاحب فرزند دو ساله&shy;ای هستم، مسئولیت سنگین برپایی اردوی مشهد را با افتخار عهده دار شدم. و در دو اردوی بعد نیز به عنوان دستیار سرپرست شرکت کردم و در &shy;تمام موارد مذکور نیز معاونت محترم فرهنگی کاملاً در جریان این همکاری بوده&shy;اند و تقسیم وظایف و تصویب این نحوه مشارکت در جلسات داخلی معاونت فرهنگی با حضور ایشان انجام شده است. شایان ذکر است مشغله کاری اینجانب در حدی است که بسیاری از روزها زمان صرف ناهار را صرف انجام مسئولیتهای شغلی می&shy;نمایم و کلیه همکاران معاونت می&shy;توانند این مورد را تأیید نمایند. با شرح ذکر شده و با توجه به اینکه وجود عبارت پرهیز از کارهای متفرقه در فرم ارزیابی اینجانب بدون شرح کامل موارد فوق، ممکن است منجر به برداشت دیگری گردد، خواهشمند است این نامه به همراه فرم فوق ثبت شود و همچنین در صورت امکان از سرکارعالی خواهشمند است از خانم دکتر خادمی در خصوص شرح کامل منظور ایشان از به کار بردن عبارت کارهای متفرقه و ارائه مستندات آن &nbsp;که در فرم ارزیابی اینجانب ذکر نمودند، استعلام به عمل آید.</p>\r\n',0,'2017-05-22 02:10:50','1495446050._21.rar','زهرا ','صدری',23000010,'1.392','1.92'),(51,'20',NULL,'<p>\r\n\tاز آنجا که بنده

که امتیاز کاملی در بحث رفتار فردی و داوطلبانه منجر به ارتقای اثر بخشی واحد خارج از شرح وظایف سازمانی و یا خارج از ساعت اداری در نظر گرفته اند، این سوال مطرح می شود که فردی که خارج از وظایف سازمانی و بیشتر از مسیولیت برای ارتقای سازمان تلاش میکند چگونه است که در بند 7 امتیاز کامل را کسب نکرده است. به نظر می رسد فردی که امتیاز کامل بند 7 را کسب کند الزاما نمی تواند امتیاز کامل بند 9 را کسب کند اما فردی که در بند 9 نمره کامل را می گیرد حتما در بند 7 نیز کاملا وظایفش را انجام داده است. لذا با توجه به این تناقض و اینکه به علت محدودیت های موجود تنها برخی از فعالیتهای خود را به پیوست ارائه نموده ام،
